# Zi Kai's 18th milestone thoughts

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
My project involves creating a website about me, the life experiences i have gone through up until now. it is like a blog of me throughout the different stages of my life that i could remember. This project is aimed at my future self first of all, so that i am able to better recollect the memories of the past and what i personally feel about it. This project is also aimed towards future employers to have a better understanding of who i am and my thoughts, to any future children i might have in the future to know more about me.
